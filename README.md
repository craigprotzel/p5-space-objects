p5 Space Objects
----------------

This is example code for the for the NYU Class [Mashups - Creating with Web APIs](https://github.com/craigprotzel/Mashups).  
	* The space data is coming from the Open Notify ["People In Space"](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) API  
	* The animation is using [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) along with the [p5 DOM library](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom)  
	* This is very much inspired by the site [How Many People Are In Space Right Now?](http://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/)
